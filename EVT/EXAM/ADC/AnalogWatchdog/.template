Description====CH32V006 series is based on barley RISC-V2C core design of industrial-grade general-purpose microcontrollers, support for 48MHz system frequency, with a wide range of voltage, low power consumption, single and dual-wire debugging and so on.CH32V006 series chip built-in 1 group of 12-bit analog-to-digital converter ADC, the sampling rate of up to 3Msps; built-in OPA op-amps to support the high-speed mode to increase the swing rate of the pressure, and the positive side of its It supports 3-channel polling; it provides 2 sets of voltage comparator CMP, 7-channel DMA controller, 8-channel TouchKey, multi-group timer, 2 sets of USART serial port, I2C, SPI and other rich peripheral resources.
